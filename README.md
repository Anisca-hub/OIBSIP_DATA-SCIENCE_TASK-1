TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning classification model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their morphological features. It demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from data loading to prediction and evaluation.
Objective
To classify iris flowers into:
•	Setosa
•	Versicolor
•	Virginica
using sepal and petal measurements.
Dataset
•	Source: Kaggle 
•	Features:
o	Sepal Length
o	Sepal Width
o	Petal Length
o	Petal Width
•	Target:
o	Species
Approach
•	Data preprocessing and inspection
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Feature selection
•	Model training and testing
•	Performance evaluation
Algorithms Used
•	Logistic Regression / K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Evaluation Metrics
•	Accuracy Score
•	Confusion Matrix
Outcome
The model successfully predicts iris species with high accuracy, validating the effectiveness of supervised classification techniques.
